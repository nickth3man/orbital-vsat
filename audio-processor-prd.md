### 8.3 Sample Database Queries

#### 8.3.1 Find all segments by a specific speaker:
```sql
SELECT ts.*
FROM TranscriptSegment ts
JOIN Speaker s ON ts.speaker_id = s.id
WHERE s.name = 'Speaker Name'
ORDER BY ts.recording_id, ts.start_time;
```

```sql
SELECT ts.*, r.filename
FROM TranscriptSegment ts
JOIN Recording r ON ts.recording_id = r.id
WHERE ts.text MATCH 'search term'
ORDER BY ts.recording_id, ts.start_time;
```

#### 8.3.3 Find recordings with multiple specific speakers:
```sql
SELECT r.*
FROM Recording r
WHERE 
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT speaker_id) 
   FROM TranscriptSegment 
   WHERE recording_id = r.id AND speaker_id IN (1, 2, 3)) = 3;
```
