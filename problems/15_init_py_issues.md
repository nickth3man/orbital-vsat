# __init__.py Issues Checklist

## File Structure Issues
- [ ] No newline at end of file (line 36, Col 2)
- [ ] Final newline missing (line 36, Col 1)

## Required Action Items
- [ ] Add a newline at the end of the file
- [ ] Ensure proper module imports and exports
- [ ] Verify initialization code is working as expected
- [ ] Check for circular imports

## Notes
* The `__init__.py` file is crucial for proper Python package structure
* Missing newlines at the end of files can cause issues with some tools and version control systems
* Consider adding docstrings to describe the package's purpose
* Ensure __init__.py only includes necessary imports to avoid slow module loading
