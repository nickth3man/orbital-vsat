  - `FileError`: File-related errors (not found, permission denied, etc.)
  - `AudioError`: Audio processing errors (corrupt file, unsupported format)
  - `ProcessingError`: Audio processing pipeline errors
  - `DatabaseError`: Database-related errors (connection, query, schema)
  - `ExportError`: Export-related errors (disk space, permissions)
  - `UIError`: UI-related errors

  - `CRITICAL`: Critical error that might cause the application to terminate

- **Detailed error context**: Comprehensive information about error conditions:
  - File paths, formats, and permissions
  - Processing stage and parameters
  - System resource states
  - Stack traces for debugging

- **User-friendly error messages**: Clear and informative error dialogs with:
  - Concise error descriptions
  - Suggested solutions
  - Options to retry, cancel, or get help
  - Details expansion for technical users

- **Global exception handling**: Catch-all for unexpected exceptions with:
  - Application recovery mechanisms
  - State preservation
  - Detailed crash reports

- **Logging integration**: Comprehensive logging of all errors with:
  - Rotating log files with size management
  - Configurable verbosity levels
